In order to use the console tool "FakeRobot" you need to compile it first. You cannot just use the corresponding .class-file in the bin directory, as the class needs the protobuf library by Google. So you need to generate a runnable JAR file. To do so you need to open Eclipse and import the complete project. Then right-click on FakeRobot.java in the Package Explorer, select Export and choose Java/Runnable Jar. After clicking Next, choose FakeRobot as the starting point and select "Extract required libraries into generated JAR" as the class needs the referenced protobuf library by Google. Then you can finish the export.
In a terminal, navigate to the new JAR file and run "java -jar FakeRobot.jar ...".
